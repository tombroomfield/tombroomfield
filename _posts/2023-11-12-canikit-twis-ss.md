I had the pleasure of being a guest on [This Week in Svelte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2Z3X6Z3Z0A) to talk about [CanIKit](https:://github.com/tombroomfield/CanIKit). I had a great time talking with [Enrico](https://twitter.com/EnricoTrain) and [Paolo](https://twitter.com/PaoloRicciuti) about CanIKit and all things Authorization.
