Throughout my career, I've always had a passion for teaching and mentoring. I've been fortunate to do this in a variety of settings, from the classroom to the workplace. I've also been fortunate to have some great mentors myself, and I'm always looking for ways to pay it forward. If you're just starting out in your career, or if you're looking to make a change, I'd love to help you out (for free!). Feel free to reach out to me at hi@tombroomfield.com.
