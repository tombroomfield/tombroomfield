Throughout my career, I've always had a passion for teaching and mentoring. I've been fortunate to do this in a variety of settings, from the classroom to the workplace. I've also been fortunate to have some great mentors myself, and I'm always looking for ways to pay it forward. If you're just starting out in your career, or if you're looking to make a change, I'd love to help you out (for free!). Feel free to reach out to me at hi@tombroomfield.com.

#### Course Feedback:

> Tom was a fantastic teacher. He were so encouraging and without a push from Tom, I might not have landed a junior front-end dev job in the last week!

> Tom was amazing. He is extremely patient and always make sure that no one's left behind. I am thoroughly enjoying this course and would 100% recommend this course!

> Our teachers were extremely helpful and great instructors. Tom was always energetic and engaging. I thoroughly enjoyed learning from him.

> Tom was able to articulate all theories and languages in a way in which I thoroughly understood and was engaged by. His language when explaining things to me was relevant to where I was at with my knowledge and could understand (not too "tech"-y) and he never made me feel like a question was silly or as if I was dumb for not knowing. 

> Tom was an extremely good instructor. He were very generous with his time and assistance, beyond the classroom. His knowledge of the field and "in the trenches" understanding of day to day stuff was invaluable. 

> Tom has been incredibly helpful during this course. I feel comfortable asking them questions and they are always eager to help.

> The amount of new skills we learnt each week was incredible. I have found a new passion in web dev which is really exciting.

> Tom is a very enthusiastic instructor with a very patient and friendly attitude towards student questions and problems!
